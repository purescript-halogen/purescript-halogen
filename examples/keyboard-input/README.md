# Keyboard Input (Event Sources)

This example demonstrates how to selectively capture keyboard events and, more generally, how to use `EventSource`s in Halogen.

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-keyboard-input
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/keyboard-input/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
