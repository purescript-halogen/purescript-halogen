# Components With Input

This example demonstrates a component which receives input from a parent component. When the parent re-renders the child component will receive a new input value and update accordingly.

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-components-inputs
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/components-inputs/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
