## Components with inputs example

This example illustrates a component with an input value. When the parent re-renders the child component will receive the new input value and update accordingly.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run example-components-inputs
```

Or from the current directory:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run build
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/components-inputs/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
