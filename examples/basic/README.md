# Basic

This example demonstrates close to the smallest Halogen component you can build. It's unlikely you'd make components this small in a real world application, but this lets you see the essential parts of a component definition.

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-basic
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/basic/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
