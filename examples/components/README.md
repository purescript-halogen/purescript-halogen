## Components example

This example illustrates a button component embedded in a parent component, with the parent component receiving messages from the button and sending queries to it.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run example-components
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/components/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
