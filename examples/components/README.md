# Components

This example demonstrates a button component embedded in a parent component. The parent component can send queries to and receive output messages from the button.

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-components
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/components/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
