## Halogen Examples

These example can be compiled from the root of the project. First, make sure Halogen's `npm` and `bower` dependencies are installed:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Then each project can be built using `npm run example-<name>`:

```text
$ npm run example-basic
```

If everything is successful the example will be built as `example.js` in the `dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
