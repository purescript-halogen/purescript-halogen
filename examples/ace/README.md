# Ace Editor

This example demonstrates integrating a third-party component. It uses queries to control behavior in Ace editor and output messages to observe changes within the editor.

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-ace
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/ace/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
