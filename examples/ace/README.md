## Ace editor example

This example illustrates a basic 3rd party component integration and use of a component output message to observe changes within the Ace editor.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run example-ace
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/ace/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
