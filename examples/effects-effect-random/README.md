# `Effect` and Random

This example demonstrates how to use an `Effect` function in a component `eval` function.

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-effects-effect-random
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/effects-effect-random/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
