# Component With Multiple Child Component Types

This example demonstrates a component which has child components of differing types.

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-components-multitype
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/components-multitype/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
