# `Aff` and AJAX

This example demonstrates how to make an AJAX request in a component `eval` function.

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-effects-aff-ajax
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/effects-aff-ajax/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
