## Random number via Eff

This example illustrates an Eff function being used in a component's `eval` function.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run example-eff-random
```

Or from the current directory:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run build
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/eff-random/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
