## Driver IO example

This example illustrates a button component that we listen to and send queries into from the driver.

Open up the browser console for evidence that anything is happening!

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run example-driver-io
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/driver-io/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
