# Driver IO

This example demonstrates running a Halogen application and communicating with its root-level component via the driver that Halogen returns to you. We can listen to the application and send queries via the driver.

Open up the browser console for evidence that anything is happening!

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the Halogen project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example-driver-io
```

This will bundle a runnable JS file, `example.js`, in the `examples/driver-io/dist` directory. You can view the running application by opening the corresponding `index.html` file.
