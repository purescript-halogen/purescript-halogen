## Module Halogen.Driver

#### `Driver`

``` purescript
type Driver f eff = Natural f (Aff (HalogenEffects eff))
```

Type alias for driver functions generated by runUI - a driver takes an
input of the query algebra (`f`) and returns an `Aff` that returns when
query has been fulfilled.

#### `runUI`

``` purescript
runUI :: forall s f eff o. ComponentP s f (Aff (HalogenEffects eff)) o Void -> s -> Aff (HalogenEffects eff) { node :: HTMLElement, driver :: Driver f eff }
```

Runs the top level UI component for a Halogen app, returning a generated
HTML element that can be attached to the DOM and a driver function that
can be used to send actions and requests into the component (see the
[`action`](#action), [`request`](#request), and related variations for
more details on querying the driver).
