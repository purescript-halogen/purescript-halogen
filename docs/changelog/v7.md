# Changes in v7

This is a crash-course on the changes from Halogen 6 to Halogen 7. Please open an issue or PR if you notice missing information or ways this guide could be improved!

Halogen 7 adds support for PureScript 0.15 and ES modules. Due to the significance of this change for PureScript projects this is a compatibility release that maintains the Halogen API almost entirely. However, there are still some minor changes.

If you are migrating an application from Halogen 6 we recommend reading through the [PureScript 0.15 migration guide](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/migration-guides/0.15-Migration-Guide.md) first, and then you should read through the Halogen changelog below.

## PureScript 0.15

Halogen 7 is the first version of Halogen compatible with PureScript 0.15. You'll need PureScript 0.15 to compile the library, and if you're upgrading your application to use PureScript 0.15 then you'll need to be on Halogen 7. We know it can be painful dealing with compiler changes _and_ library changes, so we've kept this release intentionally small.

## Other Changes

**Breaking Changes**

- The `id_` function was renamed to `id` in Halogen 6, because `id` was renamed to `identity` in the PureScript prelude. The `id_` synonym has been removed ([#791](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/791) by @garyb).
- The `autocomplete` property is no longer a boolean sum type `OnOff` and is now a dedicated `AutocompleteType` sum type imported from `dom-indexed` ([#790](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/790) by @thomashoneyman).

**New Features**

- You can now `join` forked `HalogenM` code ([#792](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/792) by @garyb)
- The `auxclick` event is now supported with a corresponding event handler ([#789](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/789) by @joe-op)
- The `srcdoc` property can now be used with iframes ([#753](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/753) by @ozkutuk).

**Bugfixes**

- The `value` property has been relaxed from being only a string to being any value which satisfies the `IsProp` type ([#791](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/791) by @garyb).
