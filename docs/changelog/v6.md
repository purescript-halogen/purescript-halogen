# Changes in v6

This is a crash-course on the changes from Halogen 5 to Halogen 6. Please ope nan issue or PR if you notice missing information or ways this guide could be improved!

Halogen 6 introduces several quality-of-life improvements for using Halogen on a day-to-day basis, without major changes to how you use the library to build your applications. It's an intentionally small release which adds polish to the library and which is the first version to support version 0.14 of the PureScript compiler.

If you are migrating an application from Halogen 5 we recommend reading through the full transition guide. However, you can also hop directly to a relevant section using the table of contents below.

## PureScript 0.14

Halogen 6 is the first version of Halogen compatible with PureScript 0.14. You'll need PureScript 0.14 to compile the library, and if you're upgrading your application to use PureScript 0.14 then you'll need to be on Halogen 6. We know it can be painful dealing with compiler changes _and_ library changes, so we've kept this release intentionally small.

## Portals

Portals provide a way to render children into any DOM node, instead of only within the DOM hierarchy of a child's parent node or parent component. They're a new feature in Halogen 6 (non-breaking change).

In Halogen 5, a child component or HTML is rendered in the DOM as a sub-tree of its parent. However, from time to time it's useful to insert a child into a different location in the DOM rather than within the nearest parent node. The canonical use case is when the parent HTML has an `overflow: hidden` or a `z-index` style applied, but a child needs to visually break out of its container -- like a dialog, tooltip, toast, or modal.

Most Halogen 5 applications solve this problem by rendering these components at the root of the application, and using messages or a global state to control when they render. For example, if a small widget needs to render an error notification, you might push to a queue in global state, which the root component then uses to render the appropriate notification on top of all other content.

Portals make this state management and threading unnecessary by allowing you to render a HTML or a child component to any node in the DOM. That small widget can now render the error notification directly to the `<body>` or a notifications-specific div outside the main application tree.

The `portal` function takes a target element and a `ComponentHTML` and renders the HTML within the target element. You can take any existing `ComponentHTML` and simply provide it to `portal`. For example:

```purs
HH.portal targetElement do
  HH.div ...

HH.portal targetElement do
  HH.slot ...
```

## Component Types

Component types have been simplified by removing the `surface` parameter.

In Halogen 5 (and prior versions), components and the internal functions which manage them carried a `surface` parameter which indicated the target for the UI to render. As no one ever wrote an alternate target from `HTML`, Halogen applications have always fixed this parameter to `HTML` in component definitions, as in:

```purs
import Halogen as H
import Halogen.HTML as HH

myComponent :: forall q i o m. H.Component HH.HTML q i o m
```

In Halogen 6 the `surface` parameter has been removed. The only real user-visible change is that components and functions which operate on them no longer carry the `surface` parameter.

```purs
import Halogen as H

myComponent :: forall q i o m. H.Component q i o m
```

This is a breaking change, but one which is easily fixed: remove this parameter from your components and any related functions and types.

Added in [#616](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/616).

## Event Handler Types

We've also made event handlers a little nicer to work with. The `Maybe action` return value has been removed from event handlers, which now return `action` directly.

In Halogen 5, when you wanted to respond to a click event, or a message from a child component, the output was of type `Maybe action`. This allowed you to selectively emit outputs (you could emit `Nothing` for some events). In practice, though, almost no one ever does this.

To remove friction around such a common task, these handlers no longer return in `Maybe` in Halogen 6. For example, this code from Halogen 5

```purs
HH.div_
  [ HH.button
      [ HE.onClick \_ -> Just Clear ]
      [ HH.text "Clear" ]
  , HH.slot _id unit component unit (Just <<< Handle)
  ]
```

becomes this code in Halogen 6:

```purs
HH.div_
  [ HH.button
      [ HE.onClick \_ -> Clear ]
      [ HH.text "Clear" ]
  , HH.slot _id unit component unit Handle
  ]
```

You're no longer able to ignore the output of a child component by providing a handler `\_ -> Nothing`. Instead, you can use the `slot_` function if you don't care about a child component's output. This code from Halogen 5:

```purs
HH.slot _id unit component unit (\_ -> Nothing)
```

becomes this code in Halogen 6:

```purs
HH.slot_ _id unit component unit
```

Added in [#636](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/636/) and [#642](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/642).

## Query Helper Functions

We've simplified the helper functions which are used with queries so that you can use `tell` and `request` directly, rather than use them in conjunction with the `query` and `request` functions.

In Halogen 5, to execute a query you would use the `query` function and combine it with the `request` function (for request-style queries, which return a result) or the `tell` function (for tell-style queries, which don't return a result). This was always a bit difficult to explain and easy to trip over when writing queries yourself.

Here's how you would execute a request-style and then a tell-style query in Halogen 5:

```purs
handleAction = do
  a <- H.query _a unit (H.request Child.SomeRequestQuery)
  _ <- H.query _a unit (H.tell Child.SomeTellQuery)
```

In Halogen 6, you no longer use the `query` function. Instead, you use `request` and `tell` directly. You also don't have to throw away the result of `tell`, as it can already be safely discarded:

```purs
handleAction = do
  a <- H.request _a unit Child.SomeRequestQuery
  H.tell _a unit Child.SomeTellQuery
```

The old `tell` and `request` functions still exist in Halogen 6, but they've been renamed to `mkTell` and `mkRequest` and are only used when querying the root of your application. For example, this code in Halogen 5:

```purs
io <- runUI component unit body

state <- io.query $ H.request SomeRequestQuery
_ <- io.query $ H.tell SomeTellQuery
```

becomes this code in Halogen 6:

```purs
io <- runUI component unit body

state <- io.query $ H.mkRequest SomeRequestQuery
_ <- io.query $ H.mkTell SomeTellQuery
```

Added in [#621](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/621).

## Event Sources

Event sources have been implemented with `Event` from the `event` library instead of the Halogen event sources implementation on top of `coroutines`. This simplifies the library internals and connects Halogen with a more widely-used FRP library.

Notable changes include:

- The entire `Halogen.Query.EventSource` module has been removed and replaced with `Halogen.Query.Event` which provides only an `eventListenerEventSource` function. The new function is a drop-in replacement for the old one, so all you need to do is update your import.
- `affEventSource` and `effectEventSource` functions can be trivially replaced with code using the `event` library directly, so they have been removed. Examples of how to rewrite these functions are below.
- The other helper functions and types from the `Halogen.Query.EventSource` module are no longer required.
- The `subscribe` function and `Subscribe` constructor no longer take an `EventSource m action` to subscribe to. They take an `Event action` instead.
- The `HalogenIO` type returned by running your root-level component now contains a `messages :: Event output` instead of a `subscribe :: Coroutine.Consumer output m Unit -> m Unit`.

If you were previously using `effectEventSource`, then you would change this Halogen 5 code:

```purs
import Halogen as H
import Halogen.Query.EventSource as ES

do
  void $ H.subscribe $ ES.effectEventSource \emitter -> do
    ES.emit emitter MyAction
    pure mempty
```

with this Halogen 6 code:

```purs
import FRP.Event as Event
import Halogen as H

do
  { event, push } <- H.liftEffect Event.create
  void $ H.subscribe event
  H.liftEffect $ push MyAction
```

When running your root component, you'll also need to replace your use of coroutines. For example, this Halogen 5 code:

```purs
main :: Effect Unit
main = ...
  io <- runUI component unit body
  io.subscribe $ Coroutine.consumer \msg -> do
     ...
```

should be replaced with this Halogen 6 code:

```purs
main :: Effect Unit
main = ...
  io <- runUI component unit body
  _ <- liftEffect $ Event.subscribe io.messages \msg -> do
     ...
```

## Other changes

Halogen 6 is an intentionally small release because it coincides with the PureScript 0.14 release. There are only a few other changes in the library to report:

- The `id_` function has been renamed to `id` now that `id` has been renamed to `identity` in the PureScript Prelude. `id_` continues to work, but has a deprecation notice and will be removed in the next version. See [#717](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/pull/717).
