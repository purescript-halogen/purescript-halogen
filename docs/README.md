# Halogen Documentation

Halogen is a declarative, type-safe library for building user interfaces.

This documentation covers how to use Halogen and provides a concepts reference. There are also other resources for learning and using Halogen, including:

* The Halogen [API Reference](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-halogen)
* [Learn Halogen](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/learn-halogen) by [Jordan Martinez](https://github.com/JordanMartinez)
* [Real World Halogen](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld) by [Thomas Honeyman](https://github.com/thomashoneyman)

## Quick Start: Halogen Guide

If you are new to Halogen we recommend starting with the [Halogen Guide](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/tree/master/docs/guide). This short handbook demonstrates and explains Halogen concepts while building components.

By the end of the guide you'll be ready to dive in to more advanced resources like the [Concepts Reference](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/tree/master/docs/concepts-reference) or [Real World Halogen](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld).

## Going Deeper: Concepts Reference

Once you're comfortable with the main concepts from the [Halogen Guide](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/tree/master/docs/guide) you may be interested in more advanced topics and in understanding why Halogen features are designed the way they are. The [Concepts Reference](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/tree/master/docs/concepts-reference) will help you understand Halogen at a deeper level.
