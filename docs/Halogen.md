## Module Halogen

#### `Driver`

``` purescript
type Driver f eff = Natural f (Aff (HalogenEffects eff))
```

Type alias for driver functions generated by runUI - a driver takes an
input of the query algebra (`f`) and returns an `Aff` that returns when
query has been fulfilled.

#### `runUI`

``` purescript
runUI :: forall eff s f. Component s f (Aff (HalogenEffects eff)) Void -> s -> Aff (HalogenEffects eff) { node :: HTMLElement, driver :: Driver f eff }
```

Runs the top level UI component for a Halogen app, returning a generated
HTML element that can be attached to the DOM and a driver function that
can be used to send actions and requests into the component (see the
[`actionF`](#actionf), [`requestF`](#requestF), and related variations for
more details on querying the driver).

#### `actionF`

``` purescript
actionF :: forall f g. (Functor f, Functor g, Inject f g) => (Unit -> f Unit) -> Free g Unit
```

Takes a data constructor of `f` and creates an "action", lifting it into
the query algebra `Free g Unit`. An "action" only causes effects and has
no result value.

For example:

```purescript
data Input a = Tick a

instance functorInput :: Functor Input where
  map f (Tick a) = Tick (f a)

sendTick :: forall eff. Driver (Free Input) eff -> Aff (HalogenEffects eff) Unit
sendTick driver = driver (actionF Tick)
```

Commonly `g` and `f` may be the same `Functor`, but when using `Coproduct`
to combine multiple algebras this function performs the work of generating
the correct value for the composite algebra.

#### `actionCF`

``` purescript
actionCF :: forall f g. (Functor g, Inject (Coyoneda f) g) => (Unit -> f Unit) -> Free g Unit
```

A version of `actionF` that lifts values into `Free g Unit` via `Coyoneda`.
This is useful in cases where `g` is a `Coproduct` containing `Coyoneda f`.

#### `actionFC`

``` purescript
actionFC :: forall f g. (Inject f g) => (Unit -> f Unit) -> FreeC g Unit
```

A version of `actionF` that lifts values into `FreeC g Unit`.

#### `requestF`

``` purescript
requestF :: forall f g a. (Functor f, Functor g, Inject f g) => (forall i. (a -> i) -> f i) -> Free g a
```

Takes a data constructor of `f` and creates a "request", lifting it into
the query algebra `Free g a`. A "request" can cause effects as well as
fetching some information from a component.

For example:

```purescript
data Input a = GetTickCount (Int -> a)

instance functorInput :: Functor Input where
  map f (GetTickCount k) = GetTickCount (f <<< k)

getTickCount :: forall eff. Driver (Free Input) eff -> Aff (HalogenEffects eff) Int
getTickCount driver = driver (requestF GetTickCount)
```

As with `actionF`, `g` and `f` may be the same `Functor`, but when using
`Coproduct` to combine multiple algebras this function performs the work of
generating the correct value for the composite algebra.

#### `requestCF`

``` purescript
requestCF :: forall f g a. (Functor g, Inject (Coyoneda f) g) => (forall i. (a -> i) -> f i) -> Free g a
```

A version of `requestF` that lifts values into `Free g a` via `Coyoneda`.
This is useful in cases where `g` is a `Coproduct` containing `Coyoneda f`.

#### `requestFC`

``` purescript
requestFC :: forall f g a. (Inject f g) => (forall i. (a -> i) -> f i) -> FreeC g a
```

A version of `requestF` that lifts values into `FreeC g a`.
