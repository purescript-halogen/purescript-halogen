## Module Halogen


The main module of the Halogen library. It defines functions for running applications
assembled from the parts defined in the various submodules:

- `Halogen.Signal` for responding to inputs and maintaining state
- `Halogen.HTML.*` for templating HTML documents
- `Halogen.Component` for building application components
- `Halogen.Themes.*` for rendering using common front-end libraries
- `Halogen.Mixin.*` for common additional application features

The functionality of this library is completely described by the type signature of the `runUI`
function, which renders a `Component` to the DOM. The other modules exist to make the construction
of `Component`s as simple as possible.


#### `HalogenEffects`

``` purescript
type HalogenEffects eff = (dom :: DOM, ref :: Ref, trace :: Trace | eff)
```

Wraps the effects required by the `runUI` function.

#### `changes`

``` purescript
changes :: VTree -> SF VTree Patch
```

A signal which emits patches corresponding to successive `VTree`s.

This function can be used to create alternative top-level handlers which use `virtual-dom`.

#### `Driver`

``` purescript
type Driver i eff = i -> Eff (HalogenEffects eff) Unit
```

This type synonym is provided to tidy up the type signature of `runUI`.

The _driver function_ can be used by the caller to inject additional inputs into the system at the top-level.

This is useful for supporting applications which respond to external events which originate
outside the UI, such as timers or hash-change events.

For example, to drive the UI with a `Tick` input every second, we might write something like the following:

```purescript
main = do
  Tuple node driver <- runUI ui
  appendToBody node
  setInterval 1000 $ driver Tick
```

#### `runUI`

``` purescript
runUI :: forall req eff. Component (Widget (HalogenEffects eff) req) (Event (HalogenEffects eff)) req req -> Eff (HalogenEffects eff) { driver :: Driver req eff, node :: Node }
```

`runUI` renders a `Component` to the DOM using `virtual-dom`.

This function is the workhorse of the Halogen library. It can be called in `main`
to set up the application and create the driver function, which can be used to 
send inputs to the UI from external components.
