-- | The type used to track a driver's persistent state.

-- | - `h` is the type of value the components produce for rendering.
-- | - `r` is the type for the render state for the driver.
-- | - `s` is the component state type.
-- | - `f` is the projected component query algebra - used for multi-child-type
-- |       components, by projecting to `z` we can avoid the need to remap the
-- |       entire component.
-- | - `z` is the unprojected component query algebra.
-- | - `g` is the component child query algebra.
-- | - `p` is the type of slots for the component.
-- | - `i` is the invput value type.
-- | - `o` is the type of output messages from the component.
-- | - `eff` is the effect row for the target `Aff`
