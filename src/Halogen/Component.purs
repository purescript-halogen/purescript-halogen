-- | The "public" type for a component, with details of the component internals
-- | existentially hidden.
-- |
-- | - `h` is the type that will be rendered by the component, usually `HTML`
-- | - `f` is the query algebra; the requests that can be made of the component
-- | - `i` is the input value that will be received when the parent of
-- |   this component renders
-- | - `o` is the type of messages the component can raise
-- | - `m` is the effect monad used during evaluation
data Component (h :: Type -> Type -> Type) (f :: Type -> Type) i o (m :: Type -> Type)

-- | The argument record for the `component` function.
-- |
-- | The type variables involved:
-- | - `h` is the type that will be rendered by the component, usually `HTML`
-- | - `s` is the component's state
-- | - `f` is the query algebra; the requests that can be made of the component
-- | - `ps` is the set of slots for addressing child components
-- | - `i` is the input value that will be received when the parent of
-- |    this component renders
-- | - `o` is the type of messages the component can raise
-- | - `m` is the effect monad used during evaluation
-- |
-- | The values in the record:
-- | - `initialState` is a function that accepts an input value and produces the
-- |   state the component will start with. If the input value is unused
-- |   (`Unit`), or irrelevant to the state construction, this will often be
-- |   `const ?someInitialStateValue`.
-- | - `render` is a function that accepts the component's current state and
-- |   produces a value to render (`HTML` usually). The rendered output can
-- |   raise `f Unit` queries that the component will evaluate.
-- | - `eval` handles runing queries to change the state of the component, or
-- |   perform some effect, or return some information about the component's
-- |   state.
-- | - `receiever` is a function that maps an input value to a query. Every time
-- |   the input value changes this query will be passed through to `eval`.
-- |   `const Nothing` can be used here if no action needs to be taken.
-- | - `initializer` specifies an optional action-style query to raise on the
-- |   component when it is first constructed. This allows the component to
-- |   perfom effects that may be necessary to set up the component.
-- | - `finalizer` specifies an optional action-style query to raise on the
-- |   component when it is being removed. This allows the component to perfom
-- |   effects that may be necessary to clean up after the component. This is
-- |   not commonly necessary - subscriptions are automatically ended internally
-- |   by Halogen, it's only required for components that manipulate resources
-- |   outside of Halogen's reach.

-- | The spec for a component. This differs from [`ComponentArgs`](#t:ComponentArgs)
-- | as it is the representation used by Halogen - the [`component`](#v:component)
-- | function translates a [`ComponentArgs`](#t:ComponentArgs) record into a
-- | `ComponentSpec`.
-- |
-- | Instead of accepting a number of properties that map things to queries,
-- | these cases are instead handled by pattern matching on a `HalogenQ` algebra
-- | that `eval` takes as an argument.
-- |
-- | Components defined with this spec can also separate the public query
-- | algebra for requests from actions that can be handled internally. The other
-- | spec formulation requires these actions to be of type `f Unit`, so in that
-- | case the query algebra must also contain the actions the component can
-- | raise internally.
-- |
-- | The type variables involved:
-- | - `h` is the type that will be rendered by the component, usually `HTML`
-- | - `s` is the component's state
-- | - `f` is the query algebra; the requests that can be made of the component
-- | - `act` is the type of actions; messages internal to the component that
-- |   can be evaluated
-- | - `ps` is the set of slots for addressing child components
-- | - `i` is the input value that will be received when the parent of
-- |   this component renders
-- | - `o` is the type of messages the component can raise
-- | - `m` is the effect monad used during evaluation
-- |
-- | The values in the record:
-- | - `initialState` is a function that accepts an input value and produces the
-- |   state the component will start with. If the input value is unused
-- |   (`Unit`), or irrelevant to the state construction, this will often be
-- |   `const ?someInitialStateValue`.
-- | - `render` is a function that accepts the component's current state and
-- |   produces a value to render (`HTML` usually). The rendered output can
-- |   raise actions that will be handled in `eval`.
-- | - `eval` is a function that handles the `HalogenQ` algebra that deals with
-- |   component lifecycle, handling actions, and responding to requests.
