-- | The main module of the Halogen library. It defines functions for running applications
-- | assembled from the parts defined in the various submodules:
-- |
-- | - `Halogen.Signal` for responding to inputs and maintaining state
-- | - `Halogen.HTML.*` for templating HTML documents
-- | - `Halogen.Component` for building application components
-- | - `Halogen.Themes.*` for rendering using common front-end libraries
-- | - `Halogen.Mixin.*` for common additional application features
-- |
-- | The functionality of this library is completely described by the type signature of the `runUI`
-- | function, which renders a `Component` to the DOM. The other modules exist to make the construction
-- | of `Component`s as simple as possible.

-- | Wraps the effects required by the `runUI` function.
type HalogenEffects eff = (trace :: Trace, ref :: Ref, dom :: DOM | eff)
 
-- | A signal which emits patches corresponding to successive `VTree`s.
-- |
-- | This function can be used to create alternative top-level handlers which use `virtual-dom`.
changes :: VTree -> SF VTree Patch
changes = differencesWith diff

-- | This type synonym is provided to tidy up the type signature of `runUI`.
-- |
-- | The _driver function_ can be used by the caller to inject additional inputs into the system at the top-level.
-- |
-- | This is useful for supporting applications which respond to external events which originate
-- | outside the UI, such as timers or hash-change events.
-- |
-- | For example, to drive the UI with a `Tick` input every second, we might write something like the following:
-- | 
-- | ```purescript
-- | main = do
-- |   Tuple node driver <- runUI ui
-- |   appendToBody node
-- |   setInterval 1000 $ driver Tick
-- | ```
type Driver i eff = i -> Eff (HalogenEffects eff) Unit

-- | `runUI` renders a `Component` to the DOM using `virtual-dom`.
-- |
-- | This function is the workhorse of the Halogen library. It can be called in `main`
-- | to set up the application and create the driver function, which can be used to 
-- | send inputs to the UI from external components.
